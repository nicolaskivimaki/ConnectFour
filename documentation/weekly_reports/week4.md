## Week 4 Report

### 9.6

I wrote more unit tests for the game to check for the validity of moves.

Hours spent: 6

### 10.6

Fixed issues related to the poetry package and dependency management. Ensured that all dependencies are correctly installed and managed using the tool. This includes resolving conflicts and ensuring the correct versions of packages are used.

### 11.6

Began drafting the implementation document. This includes describing the purpose of the game, the structure of the program, and the AI implementation. The structure and game details have been outlined, with detailed descriptions and explanations to be added next.

What I will do next:

* Continue writing tests for the game and fix any issues or bugs that are discovered during the process.
* Finish the implementation document
