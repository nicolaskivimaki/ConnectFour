## Week 2

### 26.5
Implemented the user interface using Pygame. The interface includes a game board with slots for tokens. The player can click on a column of the board to drop their token.

### 27.5
Added functionality for the player to choose token colour and AI depth. The player can select their preferred token color (red or yellow) and adjust the AI depth level (2, 4 or 6) for the AI opponent.

### 28.5
Started writing unit tests for the game using the unittest framework. Tests cover the initialization of the game, drawing the board, validating locations, and getting the next open row.

### Total hours: 20
What I will do next:

Continue writing unit tests to cover more functionalities and edge cases of the game.
