## Week 6 report

### 23.6
After recovering from my illness I was able to continue work on this course again. I expanded the tests for the game to test for specific game situations where there is a possibility to win in 3, 4 or 6 moves for the AI. I also started planning how to test the AI's defensive capabilities.

### 25.6

Finished the implementation document, created a user manual document. ALso continued writing more tests for the AI in specific situations.

### Total hours: 8

What I will do next:

* Polish my documentation.
* Add more comments to my code where needed.
* Write more tests for the AI
