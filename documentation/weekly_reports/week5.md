## Week 5 report

### 15.6
Unfortunately, I fell sick and was unable to contribute much to the project.

### 18.6
Continued researching and seeking ways to improve the game despite my illness. Utilized feedback from previous reviews to identify areas of potential improvement.

### 20.6
Spent time planning more tests for the game. These tests aim to ensure that the game functions as expected, and to uncover any potential issues or bugs.

### Total hours: 4

What I will do next:

* Catch up on the tasks I was unable to get done last week
* Begin executing the planned tests, and make necessary adjustments based on the test outcomes.
* Continue improving the game based on the feedback received from the reviews.
* Finalize the implementation document, adding detailed descriptions and explanations.
